If releasing a new version on WordPress.org you need to provide 5 changes in code:

* [ ] Change "* Version:" in plugin header (child-theme-check.php)
* [ ] Change "public $version" in child-theme-check.php
* [ ] Change "Stable tag:" in readme.txt
* [ ] Add changelog entry in readme.txt
* [ ] Add changelog entry in README.md

Have you done all steps?
